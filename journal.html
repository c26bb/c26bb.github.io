	<p>1. My first experience with my website was creating my background image/gif. I tried out several different background images until I found a gif of my favorite artist, Playboi Carti. The code for it wasn't too much of a challenge but I did have somem trouble making my image fit the screen. So far I've made my main website and several links. I stumbled into a couple of errors but it was easy to revcover from them by looking at Molly's code on the board. Soon after I created my links to my different pages, journal, projects, and about me. I learned to posision them around the website exactly where I wanted them, creating a hover over each link.  </p>

<p>2. After I created my home page, I struggled a little bit on the format and where to put my projects, Journal and About me sections. I managed to put each link at the bottom of my page with black rectangles as buttons. </p>
