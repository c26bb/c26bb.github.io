<p>1. My first experience with my website was creating my background image/gif. I tried out several different background images until I found a gif of my favorite artist, Playboi Carti. The code for it wasn't too much of a challenge but I did have somem trouble making my image fit the screen. So far I've made my main website and several links. I stumbled into a couple of errors but it was easy to revcover from them by looking at Molly's code on the board. Soon after I created my links to my different pages, journal, projects, and about me. I learned to posision them around the website exactly where I wanted them, creating a hover over each link.

2. After I created my home page, I struggled a little bit on the format and where to put my projects, Journal and About me sections. I managed to put each link at the bottom of my page with black rectangles as buttons. Labs helped out and I eventually got it done

3. My fist project was just a moving square that changed colors around the blank white page, pretty basic. It was fairly easy to create and only took about 20 minutes.

4. The music player project was not the most troubling piece of code. This was the first time I used an event listener and besides that the code was not that challenging. I didn't choose any specific song just the first thing I found in the free music download. Hopefully I will make another project using this code and maybe have it play songs that I enjoy.

5. This prject took me a while, I decided to make a quiz type of game with different musical artists. One of my favorite genres of music, pluggnb. Pluggnb is like a mix of hip-hop, trap music, and electronic. One of the best known pluggnb artist would be playboi carti or lil uzi vert, two of the most influentual artists of our generation. The type of quiz I made hade three different levels, easy medium and hard. Each row becoming artists that are more underground. The type of code I used was an event listner in a flashcard style, making different box divs and having them do diffferent things when I click.

6. I created the moving car project and came up with the idea of making my favorite sports team and their path to the playoff. The lakers have been really struggling this year starting out 2-10, but finally, they are starting to pick things up. I decided to put other teams also competing for a playoff spot in the west with them around the project as obstacles. This will sort of be like a maze I guess.
